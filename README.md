# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Prediction
Predict how much GStore customers will spend

## Description
The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

In this project, we are going to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

## Evaluation
Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:


<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\textrm{RMSE}&space;=&space;\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i)^2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\textrm{RMSE}&space;=&space;\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i)^2}" title="\textrm{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}" /></a>

where y hat is the natural log of the predicted revenue for a customer and y is the natural log of the actual summed revenue value plus one.
